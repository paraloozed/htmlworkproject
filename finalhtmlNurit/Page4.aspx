        <h3 style="text-align:center;"> This website was established in the year 2020, after Tomer found out that there are no real good course sites.</h3><br />
        <h3 style="text-align:center;">Coincidentially, Tomer has recently started using HTML and CSS and thought about making a website. </h3><br />
        <h3 style="text-align:center;"> Tomer started working on the site and soon enough finished it.</h3><br />
        <h3 style="text-align:center;"> The site went live, and Tomer was very anxious about if people will actually use this site</h3><br />
        <h3 style="text-align:center;"> The site was a huge success, and soon enough it reaped its first profit!</h3><br />
        <h3 style="text-align:center;"> The site is still not finished, but with enough work, it can be perfected!</h3><br />
        <h3 style="text-align:center;"> This website is being updated as we speak!</h3><br />
